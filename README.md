# Hypothesis Testing With Python

In an experiment, the averages of the control group and the experimental group are 169.61 and 169.88. Does it mean that the experimental group is better than the control group? Or is it just noise?

In this talk, I will introduce statistical hypothesis testing to rule out the noise. Moreover, Python-based visualization, calculation, and simulation of various topics will be demonstrated, including α, β, effect size, sample size, inverse α (false discovery rate), and inverse β (false omission rate).
